[0.03 - 15.57] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Today, we're going to be diving into the world  of artificial intelligence.  Specifically, we're going to be exploring this groundbreaking  paper that's really changed how computers understand language.  And it's called Attention is All You Need.
[16.11 - 27.59] Speaker SPEAKER_00: That's right.  This paper really was a game changer.  And it introduced what's called the Transformer, which  is like a new architecture for these neural networks, which,  as you know, are really the backbone of modern AI.
[27.69 - 37.71] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Yeah.  And you make it sound like a really big deal.  This Transformer.  So what was the AI seen like before this Transformer came  about like what problems was this paper trying to solve?
[38.05 - 53.09] Speaker SPEAKER_00: Well, you know, before the Transformer, like the main models  that we use for language processing  were something called recurrent neural networks.  A lot of people just call them RNNs.  And basically, you can think of them  as trying to understand a sentence,  but they have to go through it one word at a time.
[53.12 - 55.08] Speaker SPEAKER_01: OK, so they're kind of going step by step.  Yeah, exactly.
[54.79 - 61.57] Speaker SPEAKER_00: Yeah, exactly.  Like following a recipe, you know?  Yeah.  Each word, it's processed in relation  to like only the words that came before it.
[57.37 - 57.64] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
[61.84 - 69.00] Speaker SPEAKER_01: OK, that makes sense.  Language, it does have, you know, a natural flow to it.  So what's the main issue with that approach?
[69.18 - 84.90] Speaker SPEAKER_00: The thing is, these RNNs, they really  struggle when it comes to keeping track of things  over long sentences or long sequences of words.  Like, imagine trying to understand a really complex sentence,  but you can only really remember the last few words  that you read.
[84.88 - 86.46] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Yeah, you kind of lose the context.
[86.46 - 90.55] Speaker SPEAKER_00: Exactly.  The meaning gets all muddled, and it's really hard  to keep track of everything.
[90.70 - 98.16] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Yeah, context is everything.  So like, how does this transformer thing,  how does it deal with that issue?  I hear something about this attention idea.
[98.19 - 115.29] Speaker SPEAKER_00: That's right.  Think about it.  How do we read as humans?  We don't just process each word like in isolation, right?  We're constantly like, you know, going back,  rereading, focusing on different parts of the sentence  to really get that bigger picture.  And the transformer, it's essentially like bringing  that very human ability into AI.
[115.29 - 120.87] Speaker SPEAKER_01: So instead of going word by word, carefully, it's saying,  OK, what's important here?  Let me zero in on that.
[121.06 - 140.38] Speaker SPEAKER_00: Yeah, yeah.  And you know, it's funny because it's really a radical shift.  The transformer, it completely throws out  this whole step-by-step thing that the RNNs were doing.  It says, you know what?  We're going to lie entirely on this attention mechanism.  So it wasn't just like a small tweak.  It was a fundamental change in how we  think about processing language with AI.
[140.67 - 148.01] Speaker SPEAKER_01: No more like painstaking word by word analysis.  Exactly.  I can already see why this is huge.  What are the advantages there?
[143.87 - 144.65] Speaker SPEAKER_00: Exactly.
[148.18 - 167.87] Speaker SPEAKER_00: Well, one of the biggest advantages  is that you can do what's called parallel processing.  Since you don't need to wait for the previous words  to be processed, you can basically  process all the words in a sentence at the same time.  And this means that you can train these models way faster  and at least to, you know, much better performance,  especially when you're dealing with longer pieces of text.
[167.87 - 180.53] Speaker SPEAKER_01: OK, this attention thing, it's really got my attention.  But how does it actually work?  Like, how does the transformer figure out which parts  of the input are, you know, the important ones to focus on?  It's not just randomly picking words, right?
[180.53 - 195.36] Speaker SPEAKER_00: No, no, not random at all.  It's actually a very clever mechanism.  It's called scaled dot product attention.  And it might sound a little intimidating, but bear with me.  Imagine that each word in a sentence,  we give it a query, a key, and a value.
[200.37 - 202.95] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Sounds like we're trying to unlock some secret code here.  A little bit, yeah.
[202.80 - 213.63] Speaker SPEAKER_00: A little bit, yeah.  So think of the query as a words way of figuring out,  hey, which other words in this sentence are relevant to me?  Right.  And the keys, those are like labels  that we attach to all the other words.
[209.30 - 209.69] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Right.
[213.63 - 215.59] Speaker SPEAKER_01: OK, so each word has a key.
[215.66 - 220.37] Speaker SPEAKER_00: Exactly.  And then the values, those represent the actual information  that those words carry.
[220.45 - 224.18] Speaker SPEAKER_01: OK, so the value is like what the word actually  means in this context.
[224.18 - 232.82] Speaker SPEAKER_00: You got it.  So basically, each word uses its query  to check the labels, the keys of all the other words.  And it's trying to see which ones are worth paying attention to.  So it's kind of the matching game.
[234.15 - 260.43] Speaker SPEAKER_00: Yeah, you could think of it that way.  And the way it actually figures out this matching,  it uses something called a dot product.  That's just a mathematical operation.  But basically, it calculates how similar each key is to the query.  And from that calculation, we get what are called attention weights.  And these weights, they tell us how much focus  we should be giving to each word.  So the higher the weight, the more influence that word  has on the overall understanding of the sentence.
[260.53 - 269.25] Speaker SPEAKER_01: It's like each word gets to say something,  but the model gets to decide how much it's actually  listening to each word based on how relevant it thinks it is.
[269.24 - 281.37] Speaker SPEAKER_00: Exactly.  And here's where it gets even more interesting.  You see, the transformer, it doesn't just  use one set of these queries, keys, and values.  It actually uses multiple sets.  And we call these attention heads.
[281.52 - 288.26] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Multi-head attention.  So is it like the model is developing  multiple personalities now to analyze the text  from different angles or something?
[288.26 - 307.68] Speaker SPEAKER_00: Kind of, yeah.  When we pay attention to something,  we don't just focus on one aspect of it, right?  Like, think about reading a book.  We're paying attention to the plot, the characters,  maybe the writing style, all at the same time.  And so in a similar way, each attention head and the transformer  it kind of specializes in looking  for a different kind of relationship between words.
[307.76 - 313.33] Speaker SPEAKER_01: So one head might be looking at the grammar,  while another is trying to figure out  the emotion behind the words.
[313.25 - 321.36] Speaker SPEAKER_00: Exactly.  And this multi-head thing, it allows  the transformer to pick up on much more subtle,  nuanced relationships within the text.
[321.36 - 337.70] Speaker SPEAKER_01: So it's really understanding the text  at a much deeper level.  OK, so we've got these attention heads.  They're figuring out what's important.  But there's one thing I'm not quite wrapping my head around.  If the model is not reading the text and order anymore,  how does it keep track of the word order?
[337.90 - 355.01] Speaker SPEAKER_00: Ah, that's where positional encodings come in.  Because the transformer processes everything at once,  we need a way to tell it where each word is located  in the sentence.  And these positional encodings, they're basically  like little flags that we attach to each word.  And they tell the model, hey, this word goes here,  this one goes there.
[355.13 - 363.30] Speaker SPEAKER_01: OK, so it's like giving the model a map of the sentence,  so it doesn't get lost.  That's pretty clever.  Are there any other key parts of this transformer  architecture we should know about?
[363.94 - 383.94] Speaker SPEAKER_00: And that's the feed-forward networks.  And these are really important because they help the model  actually process the information that it's  gathered through all this attention stuff.  And it uses that information to make better predictions.  You can kind of think of them as like the final layer  of analysis where everything comes together.
[384.24 - 409.57] Speaker SPEAKER_01: OK, so we've got attention with the queries, keys,  and values.  Then we've got multiple attention heads,  and we've got these positional encodings  to keep things in order.  And then finally, we've got these feed-forward networks  that put it all together.  Exactly.  You've got it.  So that's like the nuts and bolts of the transformer.  But how did it actually do when they tested it out?  Did it live up to all the hype?  So give me the goods.  Did the transformer actually deliver?
[396.58 - 397.93] Speaker SPEAKER_00: Exactly.  You've got it.
[409.57 - 419.51] Speaker SPEAKER_00: Oh, yeah.  The results were amazing, really.  The researchers, they decided to test it out  on machine translation tasks, which  are really tough for AI to crack, you know?  You mean like translating between different languages?
[419.46 - 421.75] Speaker SPEAKER_01: You mean like translating between different languages?  Exactly, yeah.
[421.52 - 445.04] Speaker SPEAKER_00: Exactly, yeah.  Like getting a computer to accurately translate  from English to French or something.  And you know what, the transformer?  It just blew all the other models out of the water.  Really?  Oh, yeah.  It wasn't even close.  It was way faster at training for one.  But more than that, it was the accuracy.  Like for English to German and English to French,  it's at a whole new record.  State of the art, they call it.
[445.04 - 447.96] Speaker SPEAKER_01: So faster and more accurate, that's a pretty good combination.  It really is.
[447.94 - 456.90] Speaker SPEAKER_00: And it didn't stop there, actually.  They also tried it out on some other language tasks,  like figuring out the grammatical structure of a sentence.  And it did really well there, too.
[456.90 - 458.98] Speaker SPEAKER_01: What was that, danalyzing grammatical structure?  Yeah.
[458.88 - 469.27] Speaker SPEAKER_00: Yeah.  Yeah, it's called constituency parsing.  But it's basically teaching a computer  to understand how a sentence is put together,  like identifying verbs, nouns, that kind of thing.  OK, so like diagramming a sentence.
[469.04 - 472.11] Speaker SPEAKER_01: OK, so like diagramming a sentence.  We used to do that in school.
[472.11 - 477.59] Speaker SPEAKER_00: Exactly.  Yeah.  And the transformer showed that it's  got real potential there, too.  So it's not just a one-trick pony.
[477.69 - 490.62] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Wow.  So this model, this transformer, it really  did revolutionize how we think about language and AI.  And to think it's all based on this idea of attention,  something we do every day without even realizing it.
[490.76 - 509.55] Speaker SPEAKER_00: It's pretty amazing, right?  The paper attention is all you need.  It really was a turning point.  And since then, the transformer and this whole attention thing  have become like the foundation for so many other AI models.  Really?  Oh yeah, things like Google search.  Yeah.  Even the predictive text on your phone,  they're all using these ideas now.  It's wild to think about.
[505.64 - 506.03] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Yeah.  Even the predictive text on your phone,
[509.52 - 519.73] Speaker SPEAKER_01: It's wild to think about.  I mean, we use those tools all the time.  And they just seem so, I don't know, natural now.  It's really cool to kind of peek behind the curtain  and see the cleverness that goes into making them work.
[520.27 - 531.51] Speaker SPEAKER_00: I know.  It's fascinating.  And you know, the really exciting part  is that this is just the beginning.  The researchers who wrote that paper,  they even hinted at other ways we could use the transformer  for things beyond just language.
[531.51 - 533.58] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Really beyond language, like what?
[533.58 - 542.80] Speaker SPEAKER_00: Well, imagine if we could use it to understand images  or music, even videos in the same way  that it understands words.  That's pretty mind-blowing.  It is.  The possibilities are really endless.
[539.59 - 541.43] Speaker SPEAKER_01: That's pretty mind-blowing.  It is.  The possibilities are really endless.
[542.85 - 544.86] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Wow.  That's a thought to leave you with.
[546.11 - 552.45] Speaker SPEAKER_01: Thanks for joining us on this deep dive.  And we'll see you next time as we continue  to explore the fascinating world of knowledge.
